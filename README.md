# PythonGame-CP190-

Due October 21st 2023 

Prof: Daniel Kaukinen


This project is for my college Porgramming Fundamentals Course (CP190)


# OOP vs Functions:

The orignal project "Game01" was created using functions exclusivly

Testing with OOP in "Game02" to see if I can shorten the code and streamline the creation of "Rooms".

By using classes in "Game02" it makes level creation easier but is harder to understand how it works 

# Game01:

### Notes: 


## Files:

  map.py contains all the rooms/levels that you move around and the functionality of moving, looking, take, and exit.

  inventory.py contains all the items with bool values and a list of what items the charecter has.

  gameFile.py calls map.py and assigns the username.

# Game02: 

### Notes: 

## Files:

  *should probably seperate classes into other files*

  main.py contains all the code required to run the game
