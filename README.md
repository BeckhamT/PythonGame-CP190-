This project is for my college Porgramming Fundamentals Course (CP190)


## OOP vs Procedural:

Testing with OOP in "Game02" to see if I can shorten the code and streamline the creation of "Rooms".

By using classes in "Game02" it makes level creation easier but is harder to understand how it works 

# Game01:

## Files:

  map.py contains all the rooms/levels that you move around and the functionality of moving, looking, take, and exit.

  inventory.py contains all the items with bool values and a list of what items the charecter has.

  gameFile.py calls map.py and assigns the username.

# Game02: 

## Files:

  *should probably seperate classes into other files*

  main.py contains all code required for the code
